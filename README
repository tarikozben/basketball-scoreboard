Challenges
[] Rewrite scoring function using arguments (credit to Prince)
[] Write a function that will show who's leading the game
    - Tips:
        * Use conditionals: I left the barebone structure of the function in the JS file
        * Use 
            YOURELEMENT.classList.remove("leader");
            YOURELEMENT.classList.add("leader");
         to add/remove the class .leader (provided in the CSS file; it's just a simple background change) to an element. I'm not telling you which element that is, but you will not have to create a new one as you have used these constant somewhere else in your code. You do not have to touch the HTML file, nor the CSS for this function to work.
        * After creating the function, you will have to call it in some palces in your JS file. But where?
        * If you're stuck, I've pasted the whole function down below. DOn't peek unless you really have to! :D
